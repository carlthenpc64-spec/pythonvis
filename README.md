# pythonvis

pythonvis is just a simple music player with a visualizer that ONLY shows audio levels that i made, theres a readme file with instructions in the zip file.

since this is my first github repo and i genuinely dont know how to add download pages in my github repos lmfao, just download the zip in the code dropdown thingy.
